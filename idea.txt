- play as a laser pointer, try not to get caught by the cats
	- limited speed for laser pointer of course, for fairness
- start with one cat, gradually more cats and faster ones too
	- Limit cat speed at some point though :)
- cats can have different behaviour, kind of like the ghosts from waka did!
	- Have update rates for these, so that some arent completely broken
	- have one that just follows player's x and y pos ("Runny")
	- have one that follows few units ahead, updates every second or so ("Jumpy")
	- in future?
		- one that slows down to charge a quick dash in one direction ("Dashy") (have little arrow that points out from it to show direction it is going to dash, or maybe make design more pointy?)
- have some different powerups
	- treat that makes a cat make its way off screen
- on menu screen can have little facts for funsies :D
