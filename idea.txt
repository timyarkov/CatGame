CATNIPPED! Design notes

Premise - 
The player controls a laser pointer running away from cats trying to catch it. 
The laser pointer is controlled by the player by pressing and holding the point 
they want it to go towards, and the game is lost if the laser pointer makes 
contact with a cat. The game starts with one slow cat on the screen, and then as 
the game progresses, more and faster cats begin to enter and populate the screen. 
Ultimately the goal is to survive for as long as possible.

Cat types -
Cats can have different types, each having their own behaviour.
	Implemented -
	- Runny: Directly follows player's X and Y Position.
	- Jumpy: Every 2 seconds, updates the position it moves towards to be slightly ahead of
		the direction the player is going.
	- Stumbly: Every 5 seconds, heads towards a new random position.
	
	Possible ideas to implement - 
	- Dashy: Periodically slows down to charge up a dash (direction of which is shown with an
		arrow to allow player to prepare).
		- Misc note: possibly design as pointy shape to take place of arrow?

Collectables -
To be implemented, the player will be able to collect items to assist them to survive.
	Ideas - 
	- Treat: Makes one cat leave the board

Misc Notes -
- Player should have a max move speed, to avoid possible abuse (still making movement fast though, and not too sluggish).
- Would be cool to have some cool facts display on the main menu :)
